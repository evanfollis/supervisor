# URGENT — supervisor tick touched a Tier-C path

Tick at 2026-05-23T08-47-40Z violated its boundary. Investigate before the next tick.

Tier-C writes in supervisor repo:
  scripts/lib/.erofs-test-meta-reflection (matched scripts/lib/*, status=??)
  scripts/lib/TEST_WRITE_2951547 (matched scripts/lib/*, status=??)


Project HEAD changes:
  (none)

Pre-run supervisor HEAD: c5ec0d6910cb52baecf1c683f729c5579c7a8db7
Post-run supervisor dirty tree:

    ?? scripts/lib/.erofs-test-meta-reflection
    ?? scripts/lib/TEST_WRITE_2951547
```

Investigate: --disallowedTools may need tightening, OS-level sandbox may
have a gap, or a path was missed in the Tier-C glob list.
