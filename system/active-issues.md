# Active issues

## Currently live

- **Command browser-layer verification** — server-side smoke is strong, but real-browser coverage remains a machine-owned gap. Old principal FR-0015 escalation archived; replacement handoff is `runtime/.handoff/command-browser-verification-owned-2026-04-25T1310Z.md`.
- **Synaplex site V1 deploy to synaplex.ai** — site scaffold builds clean at `projects/synaplex/site/dist/`; rebrand landed; deploy still pending. IA reshape decision open (§Open design questions in ADR-0027). Dispatched to synaplex session.
- **Synaplex loop L2/L3/L4 subsystems** — L1 intake live; Layer 2 reasoning (per-beat candidate emission), Layer 3 validation (counter-search + nightly integrity), Layer 4 presentation (writeups → site + newsletter) follow ADR-0029's bootstrap throttle (≤5 candidates/beat/day for 4 weeks).
- **Skillfoundry agentic inbound deploy** — Preflight landing route + `sourceType` + watcher restart; Launchpad Lint + LCI landing + telemetry; ≥1 blog post/probe/week. In flight per the skillfoundry session (scope now spans `/opt/workspace/projects/skillfoundry/` root).
- **Discovery adapter post-fix findings** — 3 new findings from Codex review on `2f63ae5`: `parse_assumption` 3-claim collapse, migrate.py swallows decision-header parse failures, parse-one-file boundary leaking. Triaged per handoff; Finding B ships this cycle, Finding A proposal drafts for spec-review, Finding C's ADR promotes to accepted-pending-scheduling.
- **Canon schema — polarity surface underspecified** — Codex review on `weakens_assumption` narrow proposal rejected narrow path. Holistic audit (reconcile polarity vocabulary + coupled audit/citation/phase-0 surfaces + canon-CI gap FR-0035) dispatched to context-repo session.
- **Context-repo pass-2 retrofit** — M1+M2 retrofit for atlas landed (`49c24df` in atlas repo; 107/107 tests). skillfoundry-valuation-context retrofit proposal filed; awaiting skillfoundry session pickup.

## Pending principal (people-or-money only)

- **Atlas hypothesis pool rotation** — 14 formulated hypotheses never enter testing because 2 stuck BitMEX-dependent `testing` hypotheses block the loop (no data source). Recommendation A+C (auto-promote formulated + add INFEASIBLE status + feasibility check). Decision needed; handoff at `runtime/.handoff/general-atlas-pool-rotation-decision-needed-2026-04-29T17-00Z.md`. No code until principal selects A/B/C.

## Structural / background

- **INBOX proposal saturation** — 22 proposals in INBOX (3–101h aged), all Tier-B/C requiring attended session. Saturation exception active (suppressing further per-proposal URGENTs). Items include: synthesis-output-gate fix (5 lines in scripts/lib/), merge-tick-branches playbook, and 19 policy proposals. Doctor FAIL: 9 tick branches >72h. Attended session needed to disposition in bulk (bulk won't-fix + 2–3 act-ons is sufficient). 2 new proposals from 15:29Z synthesis also landed (Tier-C deferred): iteratively-patched-functions-freeze (CLAUDE.md amendment), tick-consecutive-failure-tracking (tick-wrapper.sh).
- **Synthesis output stub** — `cross-cutting-2026-04-29T15-24-48Z.md` is a 1-line path stub (synthesis job output gate missing). Fix is `proposal-synthesis-output-gate-2026-04-28T03-30-01Z.md` in INBOX (scripts/lib/ — Tier-C).

- **Operator authority loop** — attached sessions can be executive/supervisor
  with repo write but no tmux/systemd host control. ADR-0015 amendment now
  forbids routing Evan to another "full admin" agent; repeated host-only needs
  must become an explicit operator bridge/tool.
- **Executive boundary discipline** — FR-0018 and follow-ons name the pattern where the executive session patches project code instead of shaping the PM layer. Ongoing; reinforced by ADR-0020 action-default + the people-or-money rubric memory.
- **ADR-0028 post-landing artifact hygiene** — artifact inbox still needs owned browser-layer proof before retiring the old `/_inbox` stopgap. Do not ask the principal for the proof path by default.
- **Workspace CLAUDE.md versioned as of `d09d2be`** — symlink from `/opt/workspace/CLAUDE.md` → `supervisor/workspace-claude.md`. All future workspace-charter edits land in git history via the supervisor repo. Autonomous-exec loop demonstrated for this change (synthesis → translator → INBOX handoff → executive commit).
- **Cowork is a secondary friction surface** — external commentary only; not a gate, validator, or backlog priority escalator. Phase D Cowork UI remains downstream of command Phase C and broader system backlog pressure. Durable contract: ADR-0032.
